. software chain
 . in a first time, the scanning program will be implemented as a toolchain.
 In next version a gui will avoid the command line usage.

 . scanning is done by creating a new project. a project is first initialized
 with default settings that can be changed by the user. Then calibration and
 scanning sequences  are acquired. If not yet done, a calibration step must
 performed. Scanning is  finally done and outputs a pointcloud into a given
 directory. The toolchain consists of the following programs:
  . init projname
   . initialize a directory for the project projname
  . capture projname {calib,scan}
   . capture calibration and scanning sequences for the projname
  . calib projname
  . scan projname

 . the projname directory is structured as followed:
  . conf.xml
   . <cam_file>
   . <calib_frames>
   . <scans>
    . <scan>
     . <id>
     . <angle>
     . <data_file>
  . cam.xml
   . <params>
    . index
    . width
    . height
   . <calib>
    . <intrinsic>
     . focal length, fc
     . principal point, cc
     . skew coeff, alpha_c
     . distortion coeff, kc
     . focal length uncertainty, fc_error
     . principal point uncertainty, cc_error
     . skew uncertainty, alpha_c_error
     . distortion uncertainty, kc_error
     . image size, nx, ny
     . ignored, n_ima, est_fc, est_aspect_ratio, center_optim, est_alpha, est_dist

    . <extrinsic>
     . rotation vector, omc_kk
     . translation vector, tc_kk

  . calib_frames/{000000, 000001, ...}.jpg
  . scan_frames/{000000, 000001, ...}.jpg

 . the resulting cloud can then be processed using a cloud edition program,
  for instance meshlab.

 . note that some calibration files can be shared across projects

. intrinsic
 . fc, cc, kc, alpha_c, nx, ny
. extrinsic
 . tc_{h,v}, rc_{h,v}, h_{h,v}
 . where h (resp. v) stands for the horizontal (resp vertical) plane

. scanning theory of operation
 . retrieve scene information
  . get 2 points on the middle line
  . get bounding box for the vertical and horizontal shadow boundaries
 . derive extrinsic params
  . load camera intrinsic params, from calibration procedure
  . derive extrinsic params for horizontal and vertical frame using first frame
 . determine the implicit representation of shadow planes
  . estimate params of the reference planes using least square
  . determine the per frame shadow plane params
 . reconstruction
  . cast a ray per pixel and intersect with the shadow plane
 . output points

. todo
 . how to calibration
  -> read from matlab file
  -> get from opencv + slcalib

 . user interface
  . see in realtime what modifying a parameter does on the point cloud
   . frame reconstruction range
   . skip / keep frame
   . do an acquisition, insert a frame
   . clipping volume
   . rejection distance ...
   . play on calibration parameters...
  . color points that are subject to a given constraints
   -> icon: show all points
   -> substraction between all set and constrainted point set

 . meshlab plugin
  . lot of code redundant if

 . dont use std::list for point reconstruction. their number is known from
 the previous pass.

. checks
 . matrices from calibration [x]

 . line equations [ guess ok ]

 . estimtate_reference_planes: [x]

 . estimate_shadow_plane [?]
  . camera_center [x]
  . pixel_to_ray [?]
   -> il faut verifier avec un programme standalone
  . intersect_line_plane [?]
   -> seems ok

 . reconstruct points [?]
  . ssems to work

 . final ascii output [!]
